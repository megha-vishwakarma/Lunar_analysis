#Lunar Landing Site Analyzer: Safe Zone Validator
The Lunar Landing Site Analyzer (LLSA), or "Safe Zone Validator," is a proof-of-concept application designed by space researchers to address the critical challenges of autonomous and soft-landing missions on the Moon. 
It automates the complex, multi-criteria analysis required to identify validated, hazard-free landing ellipses, significantly reducing mission risk and maximizing science payload capacity.
